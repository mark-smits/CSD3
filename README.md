# CSD3 Chime Time #

Git repo for the third year collaborative project Creative System Design 2021.  
In this project we'll be making an art installation that combines wind chimes made from acrylate tubes with sensors that will drive our concetative and self modulating synths.  
  
## Explainer for each folder ##
** Chime Time Max Synth **  
In this folder we store our final max patch that will controll all audio. This patch will be a combination of the Lyra + Interaction patch and the patches in the folder 'max patches'.  
  
** Informatie Bouwen Buizen **
In this folder we'll store all information about building the actual chimes, like measurments and how to work it.  
  
** Lyra + Interaction **  
In this folder you'll find the Lyra-like synth and a few interactions with the sensors programmed in.  
  
** max patches **  
Here you'll find most things to do with the concetative synth. This includes python scripts and max patches.

** Shift register test **  
In this folder you'll find our tests trying out PWM to controll 8 leds with 4 pins.  

** Teensy **
Here you'll find most teensy related code.  
  
## Sources ##
To make the concetative synth work we will be using the MuBu for Max and FTM packages in Max MSP.
